Dell Venue 8 Pro WiFi Issue Fix
===================

Fix for the wireless reconnection issue found on Dell Venue 8 pro (dv8p).
It seems like many dv8p's are affected by an issue where wireless adapter does not wake up after being suspended. In my casem whenever the device was put to sleep, whether by screen timeout or by pressing the power button, and then woken up the wireless adapter would not reconnect to the router or the access point.
